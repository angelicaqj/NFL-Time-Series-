# NFL-Time-Series

## Description

This project would be focused on The National Football League (NFL) from the past 30 years (1991-2021). The idea is to build a prediction/forecasting model of the number of wins for a particular team of choice within the two NFL divisions during a regular season.

## Strategy

1. Plot the dataset of the team and remove trend or seasonality if it is needed.
2. Fit the best model implementing different forecasting methods.
3. Residual diagnosis to check best model assumptions.
4. Forecasting the number of wins for the next 2 years based on one NFL team.
